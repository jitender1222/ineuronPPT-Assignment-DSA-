Q.1 What's React and its pros and cons?

React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used in web development. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render components when the data changes.

Pros of React:

Component-based architecture: React promotes the use of reusable components, making it easier to build complex UIs. Components encapsulate their own logic and state, making them modular and reusable.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) called the Virtual DOM. It improves performance by updating only the necessary parts of the DOM when the state changes, reducing the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM.

Efficient rendering: React uses a reconciliation algorithm that efficiently updates and renders components when the data changes. It minimizes the number of DOM manipulations, resulting in better performance.

Large community and ecosystem: React has a vast community of developers and an extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it easy to find support, documentation, and reusable code.

Cons of React:

Learning curve: React has a learning curve, especially for developers who are new to the concepts of component-based architecture and JSX (JavaScript XML). It may take time to fully grasp the React ecosystem and best practices.

Tooling complexity: React development often involves using additional tools and libraries such as build tools (Webpack, Babel), state management solutions (Redux, MobX), and routing libraries (React Router). Configuring and managing these tools can add complexity to the development workflow.

Q.2 What do you understand by Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM is a concept used by React to optimize the rendering process of user interfaces. It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) that React creates and manipulates. The Virtual DOM allows React to efficiently update and render components.

Here's how it works:

When a React component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM representation of the component and its children.

React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM snapshot to identify the differences.

Based on the differences, React calculates the minimum number of changes needed to update the actual DOM.

Finally, React updates the actual DOM with the necessary changes, minimizing the performance impact of DOM manipulations.

Q.3 Difference between Virtual DOM vs Real DOM

The main difference between the Virtual DOM and the Real DOM (actual DOM) lies in how they are updated and their performance impact:

Virtual DOM:

Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM created and maintained by React.
Updates to the Virtual DOM are fast and efficient because they occur in memory.
React performs diffing between the current Virtual DOM and the previous Virtual DOM to identify the minimum number of changes needed.
Only the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM, reducing the performance impact.

Real DOM:

The actual DOM represents the HTML structure of a web page and is provided by the browser.
Updates to the Real DOM are relatively slower and more resource-intensive because they involve accessing and modifying the actual HTML elements.
Modifying the Real DOM can trigger reflows and repaints, which can be expensive operations and impact performance.
Changes to the Real DOM can cause the entire layout to recalculate, affecting other elements on the page.

Q.4 What's a component? Types of components

In React, a component is a reusable, self-contained piece of UI that encapsulates its own logic and can be composed to build complex user interfaces. Components can be thought of as custom HTML elements with their own behavior and state.

There are two types of components in React:

Functional Components: Also known as stateless components or presentational components, functional components are defined as JavaScript functions. They accept props (inputs) as arguments and return React elements to describe what should be rendered. Functional components are simpler and more lightweight, as they don't have their own internal state or lifecycle methods. They are suitable for simple UI elements or when the component relies mainly on props to render.

Class Components: Class components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the base React.Component class. They have their own internal state and can define lifecycle methods. Class components offer more features and flexibility, such as managing state, handling lifecycle events, and accessing the this context. However, they require more boilerplate code compared to functional components. Class components are suitable for complex UI elements that need to manage state or require more advanced functionality.

Q.5 Difference between class-based components and function-based components

Here are the key differences between class-based components and function-based components in React:

Class-based Components:

Defined as ES6 classes that extend React.Component.
Have their own internal state, accessible via this.state.
Use lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc., to handle component lifecycle events.
Use the render method to define the component's UI.
Can use this keyword to refer to the component instance.
Can use the setState method to update the component's state.
Can have complex logic and methods defined within the class.
Require more code and have a larger footprint compared to function-based components.
Historically, class components were the primary way of building components in React.

Function-based Components:

Defined as JavaScript functions.
Don't have their own internal state (prior to React Hooks introduced in React 16.8).
Can use React Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) to manage state and lifecycle functionality.
Return JSX directly to define the component's UI.
Can use closures to maintain state or access variables from the surrounding scope.
Cannot use lifecycle methods directly, but can achieve similar effects with hooks like useEffect.
Are simpler, more lightweight, and easier to understand compared to class-based components.
Since the introduction of React Hooks, function-based components have become the recommended approach for most use cases in React.

Q.6 Explain React component lifecycle

In React, components go through a series of lifecycle stages or phases from creation to removal. Each stage provides different opportunities to initialize, update, and clean up the component's state and UI. With the introduction of React Hooks, some of the lifecycle methods have been replaced or augmented.

Here's an overview of the component lifecycle stages in React:

Mounting Phase:

constructor: Called when the component is being initialized. Used to set up the initial state and bind event handlers.
render: Required method that returns the JSX representation of the component's UI.
componentDidMount: Invoked immediately after the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM tree). Used for side effects, such as fetching data or setting up subscriptions.
Updating Phase:

render: Re-render the component when its state or props change.
componentDidUpdate: Called after the component's update is reflected in the DOM. Used for side effects or updating the component based on changes.
Unmounting Phase:

componentWillUnmount: Invoked immediately before the component is unmounted and destroyed. Used for cleanup, such as canceling network requests or removing event listeners.
Additionally, there are certain lifecycle methods for error handling and controlling the rendering process:

getDerivedStateFromError: Used in error boundaries to update state when an error occurs in a child component.
componentDidCatch: Used in error boundaries to catch and handle errors within a component tree.

Q.7 Explain Prop Drilling in React & Ways to avoid it

Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing props (properties) through multiple levels of nested components, even when the intermediate components don't need those props. It can occur when components in the middle of the component tree don't consume or use certain props but need to pass them down to child components.

Here's an example to illustrate prop drilling:

```
function ParentComponent() {
  const data = 'Hello, World!';

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <GrandchildComponent data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

function GrandchildComponent({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}


```

To avoid prop drilling and make the code more maintainable, there are a few approaches you can take:

Context API: React's Context API allows you to create a context object that can be accessed by any component within its subtree. Instead of passing props through intermediate components, you can provide the required data through context and consume it directly in the child component that needs it.

State Management Libraries: Utilize state management libraries like Redux or MobX. These libraries provide a centralized store to manage application state, eliminating the need for prop drilling. Components can access the required data from the store without passing it through intermediate components.

Render Props or Hooks: Use render props or custom hooks to encapsulate the logic that requires the prop. By abstracting the logic into reusable components or hooks, you can avoid the need for prop drilling and make the code more modular.
